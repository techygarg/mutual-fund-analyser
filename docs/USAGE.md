### Custom Fund Categories

Add your own fund categories in `config/config.yaml`:

funds:
  # Built-in categories
  largeCap: [...]
  midCap: [...]
  smallCap: [...]

  # Your custom categories
  bankingFunds:
    - https://coin.zerodha.com/mf/fund/FUND_ID_1/banking-fund-1
    - https://coin.zerodha.com/mf/fund/FUND_ID_2/banking-fund-2

  techFunds:
    - https://coin.zerodha.com/mf/fund/FUND_ID_3/tech-fund-1
    - https://coin.zerodha.com/mf/fund/FUND_ID_4/tech-fund-2
```

**Usage:**
```bash
make analyze CATEGORY=bankingFunds
```

### Scraping Configuration

Optimize scraping for your needs:

```yaml
scraping:
  headless: true           # Run in background (faster)
  timeout_seconds: 30      # Page load timeout
  delay_between_requests: 1.0  # Respectful delay between requests

  # Debug mode (slower but visible)
  headless: false          # Show browser window
  timeout_seconds: 60      # More time for slow connections
  delay_between_requests: 2.0  # Extra delay
```

### Analysis Configuration

Customize analysis output:

```yaml
analysis:
  max_companies_in_results: 50     # Limit results (faster)
  max_sample_funds_per_company: 3  # Fewer examples per company
  exclude_from_analysis:           # Ignore these holdings
    - "TREPS"
    - "CASH"
    - "T-BILLS"
    - "LIQUID FUNDS"
```

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Daily Analysis Routine
```bash
# Morning: Get fresh data for all categories
make analyze                  # Extract + analyze all categories (~15 minutes)
make dashboard                # Review results
```

### Quick Category Check
```bash
# Just check midCap funds today
make analyze CATEGORY=midCap  # Extract + analyze midCap only (~3 minutes)
make dashboard                # View results
```

### Historical Analysis
```bash
# Compare today vs last week
make analyze DATE=20250820 CATEGORY=midCap  # Last week's data
make analyze CATEGORY=midCap                 # Today's data
make dashboard                               # Compare in dashboard
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Test configuration changes
make analyze CATEGORY=midCap  # Test with small dataset
make dashboard                # Check results
```

## üîß CLI Commands (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use Make, you can use CLI commands directly:

### After Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Basic usage (analysis_type is required)
mfa-analyze holdings                         # Analyze holdings specifically
mfa-analyze holdings --category midCap       # Analyze specific category
mfa-analyze holdings --date 20250826         # Analyze specific date
mfa-analyze holdings --verbose               # Enable detailed logging

# Informational commands (no analysis_type needed)
mfa-analyze --list                          # List available analysis types
mfa-analyze --status                        # Show configuration status
```

### CLI Help
```bash
mfa-analyze --help
```

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Custom Date Ranges
```bash
# Analyze specific date
make analyze DATE=20250815 CATEGORY=midCap

# Analyze date range (requires future feature)
# make analyze FROM=20250801 TO=20250815 CATEGORY=midCap
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process multiple categories
for category in largeCap midCap smallCap; do
    echo "Processing $category..."
    make analyze CATEGORY=$category
done
```

### Monitoring Progress
```bash
# Watch logs during scraping
tail -f outputs/mfa.log

# Check disk usage
du -sh outputs/

# Count processed files
find outputs/extracted_json/ -name "*.json" | wc -l
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Reduce analysis scope for faster results
# Edit config/config.yaml:
analysis:
  max_companies_in_results: 25     # Fewer results
  max_sample_funds_per_company: 2  # Fewer examples
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Regular Use
1. **Use `make analyze`** - Combines scraping + analysis efficiently
2. **Start with small categories** - Test with `midCap` before full analysis
3. **Check logs** - Monitor `outputs/mfa.log` for issues
4. **Use dashboard** - Best way to explore results interactively

### For Development
1. **Use `make test-unit`** - Verify changes don't break existing functionality
2. **Test with small datasets** - Use single category for faster iteration
3. **Check configuration** - Validate `config/config.yaml` after changes
4. **Monitor resource usage** - Watch memory and disk space during scraping

### For Production
1. **Schedule regular runs** - Use cron jobs for daily analysis
2. **Monitor disk space** - Clean old data periodically
3. **Backup important results** - Save valuable analysis outputs
4. **Update regularly** - Pull latest changes and update dependencies
