# Holdings Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Holdings Analysis?

Holdings analysis helps you understand what stocks are held across different mutual fund categories. This is valuable when you want to:

- **Avoid over-concentration** - See if multiple funds hold the same stocks
- **Find popular stocks** - Identify which companies are favored across fund managers
- **Make informed decisions** - Understand fund composition before investing

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use Holdings Analysis?

**Example scenario:** You're considering investing in multiple mid-cap funds. Holdings analysis will show you:
- Which stocks appear in most mid-cap funds (high conviction picks)
- How much overlap exists between different funds
- Whether diversifying across multiple funds actually gives you diversification

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Edit the `holdings` section in `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
analyses:
  holdings:
    enabled: true
    data_requirements:
      scraping_strategy: categories    # Organize funds by categories
      scraper_type: api               # Use API for faster scraping
      categories:
        largeCap:                     # Category name (customizable)

    params:
      max_holdings: 50                    # Top 50 holdings per fund
      max_companies_in_results: 100       # Show top 100 companies in results
      max_sample_funds_per_company: 10    # Show up to 10 example funds per company
      exclude_from_analysis:              # Ignore these holdings
        - "TREPS"        # Treasury Repo
