# Portfolio Analysis

## üéØ What is Portfolio Analysis?

Portfolio analysis tracks your personal mutual fund investments in real-time. Provide your fund URLs and units, and get:

- **Current portfolio value** - Based on today's NAV prices
- **Stock-level breakdown** - See exactly which stocks your money is invested in
- **Allocation insights** - Understand how your money is distributed across companies

## üí° Why Use Portfolio Analysis?

**Real-world scenario:** You have invested in 5 different mutual funds with different amounts. Portfolio analysis tells you:
- Total current value of your investments
- Which individual stocks you're actually invested in (through the funds)
- How much of your money is in each company
- Whether you're over-exposed to certain stocks across funds

This is especially valuable because **you might unknowingly have high concentration** in certain stocks across different funds.

## üîß Configuration

Edit the `portfolio` section in `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml

  portfolio:
    enabled: true
    data_requirements:
      scraping_strategy: targeted_funds   # Focus on specific funds you own
